      <h2>My Unforgettable Study Abroad Experience in East Africa</h2>

        Studying abroad was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my college journey. 
        For a month, I had the opportunity to explore East Africa while taking courses and 
        working on real-world projects. The first two weeks were spent on a university campus, 
        where I was introduced to Swahili and immersed in the local culture. We balanced classroom 
        lessons with weekend trips, including safaris and guided tours that gave us a glimpse into 
        the history and beauty of the region.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second half of the trip allowed us more independence. We stayed at a hotel while 
        collaborating on group projects, such as teaching secondary school students how to code 
        in Python using PyCharm. Sharing knowledge while also learning from the students was 
        inspiring and reminded me why I enjoy working in technology. In between our work, we 
        visited schools, explored markets, and went on additional tours that deepened my 
        appreciation for the country.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the highlights was creating a PowerPoint presentation with my group, divided into 
        sections covering Python basics, operations, and advanced topics like loops. Seeing the 
        students grasp these concepts was incredibly rewarding. This experience not only 
        strengthened my technical skills but also gave me memories and friendships I’ll cherish forever.

      <h2>How Studying Abroad Changed My Perspective</h2>

      <p>
        Before leaving for my study abroad program, I imagined the trip would mainly be about academics—learning a new language, 
        practicing coding, and completing assignments in a different country. While those things were definitely important, 
        the experience gave me much more than I expected. I learned about resilience, adaptability, and the value of stepping 
        outside of my comfort zone.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest lessons came from simply navigating a new environment. Whether it was trying unfamiliar foods, 
        bargaining at local markets, or learning to communicate in Swahili, I had to let go of hesitation and embrace curiosity. 
        I realized that growth often comes from situations where you feel the most uncertain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another takeaway was the importance of global collaboration. Working on coding projects with my group, then teaching those 
        skills to local students, made me see technology as more than just programming—it’s a tool to connect communities and 
        share opportunities. I left with a stronger belief that knowledge should be shared, not kept.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, my time abroad wasn’t just about school credit. It was about building confidence, creating friendships 
        across cultures, and realizing how much the world has to teach when you’re willing to listen.
