    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Brianna Boone</strong>, and I am currently a senior at 
      Michigan State University majoring in Information Science with a minor in Information Technology. 
      I have a strong passion for web development, design, and exploring how technology can connect 
      people across the world.

    <p>
      One of the highlights of my college experience so far has been studying abroad in East Africa, 
      where I had the opportunity to immerse myself in a new culture, learn Swahili, and share my 
      knowledge of Python programming with students. These experiences have shaped not only my 
      academic growth but also my personal values of curiosity, resilience, and global collaboration.
